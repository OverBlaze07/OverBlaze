    SimpleSidearms - Unofficial CE1.6 Patch

    Disclaimer: I'm in now way officially affiliated with the Combat Extended project or Simple Sidearms. I'm just a dude fixing stuff. Will remove upon request from authorized parties.

    Credits to the CE Team for CE, and PeteTimesSix for SimpleSidearms, most of this patch was shamelessly hacked from the original codebases.
